# Annoying Cookie Consent

![screenshot](images.screenshot.png)

#### This is a fun project I created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  The idea is a mock of all the countless phishing scams out there that ask for your data, only to steal your information and then turn around and sell it to other information buyers.  This project will offer you an UNBELIEVABLE LIFE-CHANGING opportunity, but FIRST you must provide your name and email.  It won't even give you an option of declining, using a toggle for the accept/decline buttons.  Once you enter your information, you will then be alerted to your mistake of trusting anyone!!!
